---

## We need a shell script to run
* This is from [this great blog](https://jonathanmh.com/how-to-create-a-git-merge-conflict/) that shows you how to quickly create a merge conflict

### Steps
1. Create a folder called `shell-script-practice`
2. `$ cd shell-script-practice`
3. Create a file that will be your shell script
4. `$ touch create-merge-conflict.sh`
5. You need to give the file execute permissions
6. `chmod 755 create-merge-conflict`
7. Execute the script
8. `./ create-merge-conflict`

That's it!
